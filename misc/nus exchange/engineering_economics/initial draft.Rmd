 Optimizing Vacant Housing Space: Selling, Renting or, Airbnbing?



```{r, echo=FALSE}

library(ggplot2)
library(grid)
library(financial)

cash_flow1 <- data.frame(time=c(0:120), positive=(NA), negative=(NA))


cash_flow1$positive[1] <- 2200000
cash_flow1$positive[2:121] <- 30250
cash_flow1$positive[121] <- cash_flow1$positive[121]+2200000
cash_flow1$negative[1]<- -2200000


ggplot(cash_flow1, aes(time, xend = time)) + 
  geom_segment(aes(y = 0, yend = positive, colour = "positive"),
    position = "stack", arrow = arrow()) + 
  geom_segment(aes(y = 0, yend = negative, colour = "negative"), 
    position = "stack", arrow = arrow()) + 
  scale_colour_manual("Direction", 
    values = c("negative" = "red", "positive" = "black"))


cash_flow1[is.na(cash_flow1)] <-0

net_cash_flow1 = cash_flow1$positive + cash_flow1$negative;
y= cf(net_cash_flow1, 0.03)
summary(y)
y
plot (y)


```


Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
